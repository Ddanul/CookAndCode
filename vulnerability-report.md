# Vulnerability Report
## 1. Missing function level access control
### Exposure
Missing function level access control is when you have a resource (object) which can be accessed by a reference then you need to ensure that the user is intended to be there.</p>

Authorize users on all externally facing endpoints to make sure that they are in fact supposed to be there.  This could affect the site by having malicious users trying to gain access in restricted locations.


### Repair
BasketItem.cs contained the vulnerability. We were able to fix the first with the following adjustment(s):



	[Authorize(Roles = "Member")]

## 2.  Sensitive data exposure
### Exposure
Storing encrypted passwords and not using a strong enough hash leaves the users information highly vulnerable to attacks.  If a hacker can gain access and correctly solve the hashing, then they can gain access to other passwords as well.

We fortunately used Microsoft Identity in our site which salts and hashes all sensitive information and stores it in a separate database for this specific reason.  No changes had to be made.

### Repair
Microsoft Identity was used.
